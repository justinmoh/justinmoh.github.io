In the culture of where I live, saying "to work" is like saying "to be a labour".  
So I do not really like to work. I did not put up my mind to be a labour, not even intellect labour.  

But I like problem solving.  
And to solve problems, I constantly learning. Learn to solve problems in the (if-not-best) better way.  

My experiences are more toward Research and Planning.  
After every tiny bit of challenge introduced by illiterate client, repeating the same simple stuff over and over again for years - Just not the life I wanted.  

I remember back when I was in the college, my first internet application assignment, was to create a website that can do CRUD interacting with database, basically a blog. Those days, we still do ASP.  
To perform interaction with database is not a challenge, the challenge is to make a fine piece of art (at your skill level):  


> me : Sir, can you read Chinese?  
> Mr. Randolph : No, why?  
> me : Just asking. I tried my application with some inputs, it's fine in english, but I couldn't get Chinese characters display properly.  
> Mr. Randolph : That sounds like a good challenge.  


As I know how stupid a user's input could be, I'm seeking for flawless piece of code.  
Then, I know where I stand.  

I define "work" as seeking for challenges and make achievements.
